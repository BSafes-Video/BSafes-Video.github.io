Welcome to the video tutorial series of BSafes. This video tutorial will demonstrate you how to use BSafes box.

BSafes box is different from folder because folder is a collection of pages but box can contain any type of item available in BSafes such as pages, notebooks, diaries, folders and even boxes. 

To create a box, first click on the blue plus button right under the activities.

The following menu will appear. Click on box.

Write the title of the Box.

Click Create button.

You will be redirected to the cover page of the box.

Here we can edit the title, add tags or open the box.

Now let’s start working inside the box. 

Click the open button shown in the right side of the box.

This will redirect to the contents page of the box.

To add an item inside the box, press the blue plus icon and select the item to be added from the menu.

Let me add few items quickly and I am also their tags. The procedure of adding items is same as we have already seen in the tutorials of diaries, notebooks and folders.

Here you can see the items are added and visible in in the table of contents of box. 

The purpose of checkboxes and small plus buttons has already been demonstrated and explained in the video tutorial of how to use BSafes folder.

Box items can be searched through tags or titles inside the box or via the main search option on the activity tab.

But, remember one important thing that items within items cannot be searched with the box search and they must be searched via the main search. 

To demonstrate this, let me add a page quickly inside the folder and set its tag as “boxpage”.

Now, I will set the same tag to the page in the table of contents of the box.

Now let’s search “boxpage” via box search.

Here you can see that only the page available in the table of contents of the box is returned in the search results. Although, we set the same tag for the page inside the folder but it is not returned in the search results (remember I told you the item within an item of the box cannot be searched from box search).

Now if we search the same tag from the main search, then we are returned with two search results that are page from the box and page from the folder inside the box. 

From this, it is clear that items within items cannot be searched with the box search and they must be searched via this main search.

Hopefully this video would help you to use BSafes Boxes efficiently. If you want to explore more about BSafes then watch out our complete video tutorial series.
