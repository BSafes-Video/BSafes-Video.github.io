First, access the BSafes website from web browser on your device by typing the its web address, i.e. bsafes.com

Once you are at the homepage of BSafes, click on the SIGN IN button at the top right corner of the homepage.   

Here, you can see two options, i.e. sign in and sign up option. If a user has Sign up already on BSafes, then he/ she will sign in to start using BSafes services.

However, if a user is new and does not has account on BSafes, then he/ she must sign up in order to use BSafes services.

There are three ways to sign up. First using your facebook account, second using your Google account and third using your email address. We will go through all of them.

#### Sign up using Facebook

To sign up with facebook account, click on facebook button. It will redirect to facebook confirmation page. As it can be seen clearly, BSafes will only require your name and facebook profile picture. 

Click continue button.

It will redirect to secret key set up page. Here, you are required to set your secret key. This key will be used to encrypt and decrypt your data on BSafes. 

This key is never stored on BSafes servers so it is your responsibility to remember it because if unfortunately you ever forgot the key, then BSafes will not be able to retrieve it for you.

There is specific criteria for setting the key. It should be at least 8 characters long and mixture of upper- and lower-case letters, number and symbols.

Renter the key to double confirm that you have set the key which you have intended in your mind.

Once you renter the key, a pop-up will appear to remind you about remembering your secret key. 

Click on OK button.

You will be back on secret key set up page. 

There is an optional field of hint. If you want, then here you can add any hint related to your key.

Once you have entered all the required details, click DONE button.

After successful registration, the welcome screen will appear. Here, you are required to enter your secret key in order to access your workplace on BSafes.

#### Sign Up with Gmail or G+ Account

To sign up with Gmail or G+ account, click on red Google button. 

You will be asked to enter your gmail account and password. 

Once you enter required details, you will reach secret key set up page. Rest of the process is same to set up the key as we have seen previously using facebook account.

#### Sign Up with Email

To sign up with email, click on sign up option.

You are required to enter your email address on this page.

Press START button.

This page requires you to enter verification code that has been sent to your provided email address from BSafes.

Here you can see that code is received in this email from BSafes.

Enter this code and click Verify Button.

The next page would require you to set your username and password (remember that password is different from secret key).

Set a password while keeping in mind the criteria for it.

Once all the required details are entered, then click SEND button.

This will take you to the secret key set up screen.

Rest of the process is same to set up the key as we have seen previously using facebook account.

Hopefully this video would help you for signing up on BSafes. If you want to explore more about using BSafes then watch out our complete video tutorial series.
