Let me ask you couple of questions.

Do you use note taking apps frequently?

Are you sure that your data is safe with these apps?

If not, then you may have to rethink about it and your possible next choice should be the BSafes.

What is BSafes?

BSafes is a secure note-taking app with collaborative capabilities for teams or individuals for just $2.99 per month where first month is a free trial. BSafes uses end-to-end encryption while many other note taking apps do not, that means your data might be readable at servers of various other note-taking apps but with BSafes servers your data is scrambled and secure which means even we cannot access or modify your scrambled data which makes it impossible for hackers as well.

BSafes is not just a note taking app, but it also offers collaboration capabilities for teams. Which means, teams can share their data with each other, or team members

can keep their data separate within the safe and secure environment of BSafes.
